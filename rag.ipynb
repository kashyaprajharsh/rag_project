I would now like to welcome Amit  for his opening comments.  \\n \\nAmit Syngl e: \\nHello, everyone. Welcome to the Investor Conference for Q1 FY24. It's a pleasure to be with  \\nall of you.  \\n \\n \\nWe have always spoken about delivering joy since 1942. And as a brand, we exist to Beautify , \\nPreserve  and Transform all the spac es and object s, bringing happiness to the world.  This is  our \\ncore value and we have been speaking about it in terms  of where our brand is and where we \\nwant to take the brand as we go forward.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'ASIANPAINT_jul23.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content='3 | P a g e  \\n  \\nOverall, when we look at Q1 FY24, it has been a strong quarter from the point of view of \\noverall volume growth which we have been able to deliver . This has also  been a consistent \\npromise  and what we have  been pursuing for the last 12 quarters. We registered  double digit \\n10% volume growth . Over a four -year period , this was clearly a strong double -digit 17 .5% \\nCAGR . Even the value number was relatively strong at about 8%.  Please remember, that this \\nwas over a very  high base last year where we had grown by value of about 59%. It was also a \\nprice increase base and growing over a lower covid  base of previous year , 8% on t hat is a still \\na relatively healthy number delivered this quarter.  \\n \\nSimilarly, the volume base was strong at 37% over which 10% growth has come in. We see \\nthat across geographies , this is  broad base d growth giving us confidence that it was a strong \\nquarter .'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'ASIANPAINT_jul23.pdf', 'page': 4}, page_content='4 | P a g e  \\n  \\nWhen we look at the last few quarters , you will see that the result is consistent in terms of \\nlooking at the volume base to growth.  The 4-year CAGR over the various quarters have been \\nin the band of about 15 -20%. This shows  our commitment to overall g rowth , and we have \\nbeen keeping pace with the same over previous  quarters .  \\n \\nGoing ahead , let’s take a  look at some of the parameters on how we would qualify the quarter . \\nFirst of all, I think the good part is that compared to Q3, Q4 of FY23, we saw rural growth \\ndefinitely improving and coming closer to the urban markets, which was a good sign.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'ASIANPAINT_jul23.pdf', 'page': 5}, page_content='5 | P a g e  \\n We saw almost similar growth  between the two . Over a period of time , we are seeing that the \\n4-year CAGR across rural urban areas are kind of same.  The overall product mix was led by  the \\neconomy and premium range growing. The luxury range was  a bit down, but both economy \\nand premium range did well . \\n \\nIn terms of specifics , we saw Smart Care waterproofing, which has been on a strong growth \\npath over the previous qua rters continue to maintain growth. The wood finishes, which is a \\nstrong area with lots of premium finishes also grew quite well . Enamels again which has a \\npremium component , grew  well and the economy emulsions which get into the bottom of the \\npyramid in te rms of people coming in from the unorganized sector to the organized sector , \\ndid quite well.  \\n \\nOur distribution expansion in terms of increasing our footprint continued in a strong manner. \\nWe had reported about 1.5 lakh retail points earlier till the end o f last year. We have added \\ngood numbers of about 6 ,000-10,000 retail points  in Q1 which is a signal to the market that \\nwe would like to keep up our presence  in every geography as we go ahead, even with respect  \\nto the T3 -T4 towns.   \\n \\nServices has been on a strong pitch , and I think this is something which differentiates Asian \\nPaints . Our Safe Painting Service  (SPS) , which comprises of the Trusted Contractor Service  \\n(TCS)  has done extremely well and now we are present in more than 650 to wns with  revenue \\nalmost doubling in Q1 . This signifi es that today  the trust levels of service are very high , and \\nwe speak of a fairly high NPS score. Overall , from the point of view of retail versus projects \\nbusiness, the projects /institutional business grew faster , and it was led by good construction \\nactivity which propelled the builder sector.  We saw good spending from government and also \\nfactories did quite well. This B2B part of the business has been spearheading growth in a very \\nstrong manne r for us . \\n \\nFrom a point of view of innovation , new products have been fairly consistent , and we have \\nbeen  speaking about the band of 11 -13% contribution to the overall revenues  This quarter , \\nalso we saw about an 11% contribution . We have already announced that there are various \\nexpenditures which we have committed in terms of going forward. We had spoken of about'),\n",

And today the overall capacity \\nexpansion has been going on pretty well and we are on sched ule. \\n \\nThis slide gives a brief of the larger areas at work. I spoke about innovation and being a leader . \\nThis is called Nilaya  Naturals. This is a super luxury product at the highest point.  This is \\nsomething which is a n organic emulsion packed with 90% or ganic materials which are earth -\\nsafe with more than 200  shades . It’s got a very good vintage matte look  and is  very popular \\namongst architect designers and therefore this is our attempt to take on the super luxury \\nspace and offer an organic and green product .'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'ASIANPAINT_jul23.pdf', 'page': 7}, page_content='7 | P a g e  \\n We look at really enhancing  décor on the walls in a very strong manner. These are a large set \\nof Italian finishes which we have introduced in the market and is very popular amongst the \\nAID segment. Some of these finishes are ve ry expensive and in the super luxury category , at \\nthe top -end of the market.  \\n \\nSome clear innovation products which have strong propositions . We are talking in terms of \\nluxury exterior paint, which comes with a 15 +15+15 warranty, which is for durability, for algae  \\nand for the waterproofing.  We are looking at ‘Hydroloc  Xtreme ’, which can be applied on \\nalmost 70% damp walls, a technological innovation. And lastly, an ‘Anti Insect ’ paint  that keeps \\ncommon insects away. So, a ll thing s which are really world cl ass, including ‘Purafin ’, which is \\none of the PU finishes look ing at the mid-premium segment of wood finishes, which for the \\nfirst time is coming in this range.   So, as I said, every product here is in the premium and the \\nluxury  range .'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'ASIANPAINT_jul23.pdf', 'page': 8}, page_content='8 | P a g e  \\n  \\nShifting from the ‘share of surface ’ to the ‘share of space ’ business, which is our Home  Décor. \\nThis has been a journey which we have been pursuing over the last few years  and we  see \\ntoday we are at about 4% of our decorative revenue. And this is what we ar e steadily \\nincreasing as we are going forward . Today , we have become clearly the number one integrated \\nhome player in terms of offering customers décor under one roof through our 44 Beautiful \\nHome s (BH)  stores which we have put across geographies in India.  And this makes us very \\nstrong in terms of catering to the customer, because as we said , Home Décor compl iments  the \\ncoatings business because you are part of the consumer décor lifecycle.  \\n \\nWe have become number two in the fabric and the furnishing business . We have a co -branding \\narrangement with ‘Pure’ brand. We have got into areas like wallpaper through collaborations \\nwith ace designers like Sabyasachi, Sarita H anda and have also done collaborations with \\npartners like Jaipur Rugs. We introduced the area of lighting and  flooring and also the doors \\nand windows with uPVC. We are number one in wall covering s and texture. So , what you see \\nis that literally in terms of most of the categories, you are becoming amongst the top two \\nplayers in t he market, including becoming the number one player in the integrated décor  area .'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'ASIANPAINT_jul23.pdf', 'page': 9}, page_content='9 | P a g e  \\n  \\nWe already have a Kitchen and Bath business which has been there . The Kitchen business has \\nbeen doing well. We experienced a growth in the F KD business , but t he components  business \\nwas slow. We had a high price increase base last year and therefore from that point of view , \\nwe had a 12% de -growth  in terms of our revenue . As far as the PBT is concerned, we improved \\nour margins in the Kitchen business , and we were at about a m inus Rs. 2 crores, kind of an \\noverall PBT . As far as Bath is concerned , again Bath was affected by a strong price increase \\nbase , and we almost have a  breakeven here against a Rs. 4 crores profit which we had last \\nyear.  \\n \\nSo, I think we were quite affected given the fact that the bases  were high because of the price \\nincrease. We feel that  next quarter would be much better in terms of the two businesses going \\nforward .'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'ASIANPAINT_jul23.pdf', 'page': 10}, page_content='10 | P a g e  \\n  \\nLuxury kitchens, which are be ing launched under the ‘Cres t’ brand by Sleek, is something in \\nthe range of about Rs. 12-15 Lacs per kitchen.  Again, a lot of work happening at the luxury \\nend here.  \\n \\nWe also have now our ‘Nilaya ’ furniture, which is having European sensibilities with Indian \\ncomfort.'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'ASIANPAINT_jul23.pdf', 'page': 12}, page_content='12 | P a g e  \\n  \\nAs far as  the two new acquisitions are concerned  - White Teak  did extremely well at almost \\nabout 28.4% growth . We also had good profitability in terms o f PBDIT from this business. We \\nhave added more stores , both company  owned and franchise owned stores , apart from the \\nfact that the 44 BH stores are selling White Teak . We have acquired another 11% additional \\nstake in June 23, taking our share to about 60% now. So , it has become our subsidiary. As I \\nsaid earlier , we are number one in terms of decorative lighting here .  \\n \\nAs far as we look at Weatherseal , last year we had doubled the sale and this year also we are \\ndoing quite well.  We have already registered a bout  Rs.9.8 crores of net sales and therefore \\nexpanding these businesses . Both the businesses have , done very well in Q1 and we have \\nstrong hopes in terms of taking it  ahead in terms of what we want to do .'),\n",

This \\nis the next frontier of our journey on  home décor . This store has come in Chennai in Anna \\nNagar and it's about 17,000 square feet. This s tore is comparable to a store  which would be \\nin Paris, L ondon or New York and very high -end luxury . It has really taken Chennai by storm. It \\nis really high -end from the point of view offering  - decorative lighting, furnishing , furniture \\nand lots of other areas. So , I think this is our journey towards taking the  luxury end again, in a \\nstrong manner as we go ahead.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'ASIANPAINT_jul23.pdf', 'page': 14}, page_content=\"14 | P a g e  \\n When we look at the International business, it comprises of our operations in Asia, Middle \\nEast, Africa largely.  \\n \\nIt was a mixed bag in terms of the International  business. If we look at the businesses in Middle \\nEast and in Africa, we did quite well, including South Pacific . I think where we were hit was \\nAsia, largely in the case of Nepal, where there is a little bit of a n economic crisis going on . \\nThere's a liquid ity crunch and I think th at is where we de-grew  and this had  a quiet  of effect \\non the overall Asia business, and it also had a n effect on the overall global business. In fact, \\nwhat we have been seeing is that in some of the markets like Bangladesh, Lanka a nd Egypt, \\nthere has been devaluation of currency . So, if you were to see this degrowth of 1%, but you \\nwere to convert it into constant currency terms, it comes to about 4% growth. So , in that \\nsense, I think the overall business is still about 4% positive.  \\n \\nAs far as profitability goes, a large part of profitability comes from Nepal. And as I said, the \\nNepal market has been down. Overall , we registered lesser profits from last year, but there \\nwas still overall profits of about Rs. 27 crores in this year. PBT  levels have dropped down, but \\nwe are hopeful that Asia recovers as we go forward because a lot of business comes from \\nNepal, Bangladesh and Lanka in our  international foray.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'ASIANPAINT_jul23.pdf', 'page': 15}, page_content='15 | P a g e  \\n  \\nGoing ahead , our Industrial business has been the star business in Q1. Very strong top line \\ngrowt h coming in . The PPGAP  business, which is the business which caters to auto OEM  and \\nrefinish es market has done extremely well at about 13% top line growth with both auto  OEM  \\nand refinish segment doing quite well. We  have got good realizations in the market from the \\npoint of view of our prices, which we had with our B2B customers.  There has been an effect \\nof the softening of the raw material prices a little bit, which has led to a strong number coming \\nin terms of PBT. The number is heartening and augurs  well for us .  \\n \\nWhen we look at the other business which is the General Industrial  business, which is APPPG , \\nI think the growth has been consistent.  If you look at the last 10 to 12 quarters, it has been \\ngrowing in double digits and we delivered almost Rs. 300 crores here with 22% growth . The \\nprofitability numbers were also strong which  was aided by the softening of the raw material  \\nprices  and a lot of work in terms of improving margins. Both businesses are g rowing from \\nstrength to strength and this is really adding to the brand in a big way.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'ASIANPAINT_jul23.pdf', 'page': 16}, page_content=\"16 | P a g e  \\n  \\nSo, if you look at gross margins - we are looking at almost a 9-quarter  high .  We have seen \\ndeflation in Q4 FY23 and we have seen deflation of about 2% in the current Q1 of FY24. We \\nsee that the overall gross margins have gone up to about 43.4%.  And this has been also aided \\nby a lot of work which  we have been doing with respect to the formulation and sourcing \\nefficiencies. So , this is a strong number as far as the overall gross margins are concerned.  \\n \\nIn totality, with respect to  the financials at a standalone level , if we look at the top line, it's \\nabout 7% growth led by double -digit  almost 10% volume growth . As far as the gross margins\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'ASIANPAINT_jul23.pdf', 'page': 17}, page_content='17 | P a g e  \\n are concerned, we are almost up by 550 bps. If we were to look the point of view of last year,  \\nsame quarter I think very strong 43.4% margin.  If we look at PB DIT margins, they have gone \\nto 24.7% from 19.4% in Q1 last year. And sequentially also, they have gone up by about 170 -\\n200 b ps. So stronger growth happening with respect to margins aided by so me softening in \\nterms of the prices.  But this has obviously given a lot of impetus with respect to PAT numbers \\nin terms of what you are seeing on screen . \\n \\nAt a consolidated  level , the numbers are not too different. Obviously, top line is more or less \\nclose  to the standalone number of 7%. Again, gross margins are strong at about 42.8% , a 530 \\nbps improvement . At PBDIT compared to last year Q1  at 23.2 against an 18.1 number and \\neven on a sequential last year quarter, we see a gain of about 190 bps. PAT has been fairly \\nstrong in terms of what we have been able to see. There has been a one-time  adjustment \\nwhich we have indicated as a no te in the financials.  But overall, even if we were to take that \\none-time kind of benefits  out, the growth in terms of both PBDIT as well as the overall \\nnumbers has been quite strong.  \\n \\nSo, what we are saying overall is we have had a  good start  as far as FY24 is concerned . Our \\nforay  of double -digit  volume growth continues, which gives us confidence in terms of our \\nperformance.  Home Décor, while Kitchen and Bath have been a little bit sluggish, but overall, \\na plethora of other categories like fabrics, lighting, uPVC,  all kind of giving us good growth  and'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'ASIANPAINT_jul23.pdf', 'page': 18}, page_content='18 | P a g e  \\n we think as a combined business this is something which is galvanizing us and giving us \\nstrength with respect to our core business.  As I said, it is making us part of the consumer life \\ndécor journey. The Industrial business on a clear uptick, giving u s double -digit revenue growth \\nand this is a business which has been growing at this rate for the last few quarters and \\ntherefore clearly the journey has been strong in terms of what we see going ahead . \\nInternational , a little bit less up to our expectations , but I think the forex tightness, the \\ndevaluation and so on, so forth are a bit of a challenge, but we still see that if we are able to \\nkind of overcome Asia business, I think it will give us good growth and good p rofit as we go \\nahead.  \\n \\nOverall, from the point of view of operational efficiencies, a lot of work is happening both \\nfrom the point of view of sourcing  and formulation and I think this is adding to the softening \\nof the raw material prices and giving us bene fits. So net net, a great start . \\n \\nOn to ESG , I think all of you would have seen our annual report, which has a strong component \\nof intertwining business with ESG numbers. I think strong progress with respect to the three \\nareas of Environmental, Social and  Governance in terms of what we have taken up  and I think \\nthese areas are something which we are steadfastly pursuing within the organization .'),\n",

What you see is what we have achieved \\nin FY23 and then we have looked at two buckets, which is the 2025 bucket which you see in \\ngrey, and the pink bucket, which is the 203 0 bucket . So overall it's the audacity of the brand \\nthat we are committing upfront to the ESG framework.  On the Social front also , a lot of work \\nis being done in terms of being water positive and we are getting into a lot of areas which \\ngenerate some water in the env ironment. We are also looking at  the area of health care \\ninitiatives and training people from the point of view of making them win livelihoods.

The Indian \\neconomy is still pretty good as compared to what we are seeing  in terms of the world \\neconomy, whether it is Europe or US or even China and we will continuously push for \\naggressive growth . Our growth focus definitely would remain. As I said, the rural demand has \\nbeen good in Q1 and we see that given the fact that the monsoons today are appearing to be \\nquite good, we would be banking on rural growth going forward.  \\n \\nRaw material prices, while I think they hav e been going down, we are seeing some increases . \\nCrude is at a n all-time  high in terms of what we see ., We do not know what trajectory the \\ndollar and the rupee take as we go ahead. So , we are watching the environment and seeing \\nwhere is the raw material  stabilizin g, and then we  will take a call on our pricing going ahead .  \\n \\nAs far as the festive season is concerned , we are looking at it very, very strongly because this \\ntime we have a longer season and therefore we think it should be a good season.  \\n \\nOur Home Décor initiatives are strong , and I think they will keep multiplying going ahead and \\nthe Industrial business w ill keep on adding to the overall décor  business.'),\n",

Thank you so much.  \\n \\nModerator:  \\nWe now begin the Q&A session .  \\n \\nAbneesh Roy  (Nuvama) : \\nMy first question is when I see your gross margin  that is at a 9-quarter  high and when  I see  \\nother FMC G categories like soaps and detergent, wherein also the gross margin expansion has \\nhappened, local and regional players have come back strongly in terms of either pricing or in \\nterms of local marketing.  So, could you take us t hrough what is happening in the 30% local \\nmarket share , which is there . Are you seeing players cutting prices, for example, and are they \\nalso starting more of  advertising  and what is your response to that? Because that's a large \\nmarket and you are equally aggressive in the lower end of the market.  \\n \\nAmit Syngle:  \\nFor us , the bottom of the pyramid is a very strong market , and we look at getting the \\nunorganized customer into the organized brand. Our work emanates in two manners. One is \\nin terms of expanding our  footprint so that we are able to reach out to smaller towns.  Second, \\nwe have a very strong program in terms of below the line marketing initiatives, in terms of \\nwhat we place in the market. So , whether it is work around influencers, whether it is the work  \\naround wooing the consumer, or it is  with respect to even the work in terms of looking at \\nbrand displays at the shops, I think we do a huge amount of work there too, so a large \\nexpenditure possibly goes.  Similarly, I think the differential schemes to woo the retailers to \\nstock the material and sell them at a strong incentive to the customers is what we do. So , our \\nconcentration has been led by below the line initiatives and topped with a focus on ‘Above \\nthe line ’ advertising.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'ASIANPAINT_jul23.pdf', 'page': 22}, page_content='22 | P a g e  \\n  \\nGoing forward , we are lookin g at giving an impetus to our advertising and looking at these \\nbelow the line initiatives. What we see very clearly, is the strength of the brand w here we are \\nable to command a premium with respect to selling prices and despite the fact that we see \\nsome di scounting by local players and in some cases also advertising . Today our Q1results also \\nindicate in that segment we are able to really get good numbers and good response. So , I think \\nnet net our initiative of ‘Above the line ’ and ‘Below the line ’ will continue in a strong manner . \\nWe would  be strong with respect to our initiatives in terms of what we want to put to woo  the \\nconsumer  and we might even look in terms of saying that as we go forward, depending on \\nhow the raw material  prices fare out, we  will look if we need any price corrections.  \\n \\nShirish Pardes hi (Centrum) : \\nI do understand on a base of 37% volume growth, the volume is about 10% growth. But just \\nwanted to understand, because you made some remark, that the premium luxury segment is \\nnot to  the expectation in the middle and lower end is grown  faster.  Is this the industry trend \\nbecause the local competition has picked up very well and I think there is a pressure and \\nobviously the demand is high at the lower end. And in that context, I think I do understand \\nyou have prioritised  the gross margin and do you think in the medium term we have a pressure \\nto drop the prices?  \\n \\nAmit Syngle:  \\nThere is no middle and lower end premium and luxury . There are only three segments : \\neconomy segment, premium segme nt and luxury segment. What I said was that the economy \\nand the premium segments are doing well , and the luxury  is a little bit down. If you look at \\nthe market constraint,  the economy segment is the biggest segment which is there, followed \\nby premium and luxury.  And therefore , you will have to perform in the economy segment if \\nyou are looking at overall volume and value growth in terms of turn ing the tables. I think the \\npremium segment has also done fairly well , riding on wood finishes , riding  on adhesives  and \\nriding  on enamel s. \\n \\nOverall, we think the premium segment has been strong. I think the decision with respect to \\npricing is totally related to how the whole area of raw material prices pan out. We are now'),\n",

So, we are watching it carefully  \\nand if the trends are clear, we would look at price correction in that case . Having said that, we \\nare not  seeing local companies, at least in the paint industry, doing very well.  Possibly we \\nwould have gain ed from some of the local competition in terms of the overall economy \\nsegment.  \\n \\nShirish Pardeshi (Centrum) : \\nOn the non -decor  part, the Industrial business  and Home Improvement , The Industrial \\nbusiness has shown momentum .  So, in your sense, is it completely normalized because auto  \\nOEM  and auto refinish business has done exceedingly w ell, despite the high base. In that \\ncontext , is there further recovery expected or this is the normalized base and we can build on \\nthis. And second, on the Home Improvement, exactly what has gone wrong, because both  \\nSleek and Ess Ess have declined very sharply.  \\n \\nAmit Syngle:  \\nWhen we look at the Industrial business, I don't think  it has reached a place where it cannot \\ngrow and we did not have any price increase bas es there . I think they were normal bas es in \\nterms of what we saw last year. The General Industrial business comprising of Protective \\npaint s and Powder coating is something which is on the rise , and I think what we see is that \\nnot many industries are coming up. Players are expanding and we see a lot of opportunity in \\nthe government infrastructure business, which is also seeing a lot of money getting pumped \\nin. As far as auto is concerned, I think both  two-wheeler and  four-wheeler , we are seeing \\nstrong growth  with the additional lines, the whole area of EV coming up and so on and so \\nforth. Both businesses are promising that the uptick should continue in terms of the overall \\ndemand as we go ahead.  \\n \\nAs far as the overall Home Décor business is concerned, four categories have grown and two \\ncategories are down.  So, I don't think things are terri bly wrong there . In the two businesses, \\nwhich have degrown a little, we had very high bas es because of price increases and that could \\npossibly get corrected as we go ahead in Q2 and Q3.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'ASIANPAINT_jul23.pdf', 'page': 24}, page_content=\"24 | P a g e  \\n As far as the Kitchen FKD business is concerned, we are buoyant because we are number one \\nin terms of that FKD business. And even with respect to the Bath business, I think it will \\ndefinitely come up going  forward. So overall, I think net net , four categories have done well \\nvery c learly in terms of what is there and two categories have gone down.  Overall , Home \\nDécor, had a fairly good growth.  \\n \\nShirish Pardeshi (Centrum) : \\nSo, you think second half is going to be better as compared to the Q1 weakness ? \\n \\nAmit Syngle:  \\nWe think the business would definitely improve because the weakness was coming also \\nbecause of a little bit of a base which was very high.  So definitely there will be an \\nimprovement.  \\n \\nAvi Mehta  (Macquarie) : \\nI just wanted to build on the margin point a litt le. Basically, are there any one -offs in the other \\nexpenses that we saw this quarter?  And the second also related is because you are pointing \\ntowards resurgence of input costs, would you suggest that the current gross margin \\nperformance is something that c ould be at risk?  \\n \\nAmit Syngle:  \\nIf you take the t wo one -offs which were there, one is in terms of some dividend income which \\nwe got from our industrial JV  and the second has been a provision reversal with respect to \\nsick leave entitlement in terms  of the positive change for our employees going forward. I think \\nif you take out the one-offs, the margin position is still healthy . So, I don't think the one -offs \\nare really influencing the numbers in a strong manner. And secondly, the overall margin \\nnumbers are also closely governed by how raw material prices pan out in the market . You have \\nseen that during the whole period of inflation, when the inflation levels had gone to about 20 -\\n25-30% level s, despite taking price increases, the PBDIT  margins had gone almost to about 15 -\\n16% levels. Today the raw material  prices and  the environment makes a huge impact with \\nrespect to that.  We feel that for the year, our commitment to the overall band  of the PBDIT\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'ASIANPAINT_jul23.pdf', 'page': 25}, page_content='25 | P a g e  \\n remaining between 18 -20%, should be sacrosanct. That is something which we are committing \\nfor the year , and which should remain.  \\n \\nAvi Mehta (Macquarie) : \\nI was just trying to push the bubble  by saying that given one does not have a material one \\ntime , what we saw almost about 2 3% margin, that logically one does not see any risk to that \\ncontinuing and hence there could be possibly an upside risk to your guidance ? \\n \\nAmit Syngle:  \\nYou are right as it depends also in terms of if we really look at some changes with respect to \\npricing i n other areas, then possibl y it woul d, come down and might not remain in this level.  \\nI mean if there is going forward in H2, we see a larger inflation kind of coming back. But I think \\nwe are in a good positive band in terms of what we are looking for  the y ear. \\n \\nAvi Mehta (Macquarie) : \\nJust a clarification. The festive demand strength should reflect in the next quarter because the \\nchannel gets filled . So, the longer festive period benefit should flow through in the second \\nquarter. Is that understanding correc t? \\n \\nAmit Syngle:  \\nWhat happens is that retail season is about at least about 45 days before the festival. So , if \\nDiwali is in the first week of November or in the first ten days of November, normally what \\nhappens is that the period from 15 September to Octo ber end would be a strong retail ing \\nseason.  We feel that the larger impact would come into Q3, but impact should come into Q2 \\nas well because there is a retailing period which gets impacted by the festive area. So , we \\nwould see that both quarters show an uptick with respect to the long festive season . \\n \\nSheel a Rathi  (Morgan Stanley) : \\nMy first question was with respect to the distribution, the dealer network, which we have \\nadded this quarter about 6 ,000 dealer  points and this year  we have guided to about 10 ,000 -\\n15,000  dealer points . Just wanted to understand we are looking to get more into smaller cities. \\nSo here what  I want ed to understand is do we have a number in mind in terms of how many'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'ASIANPAINT_jul23.pdf', 'page': 26}, page_content=\"26 | P a g e  \\n Asian Paints  dealers, a sma ll town could have? And  in general , how long does it take for the \\ndealer to generate the requisite ROI? And has there been any change in terms of the timing \\non generating the ROI; because, companies like yours and other competition  are also talking \\nabout b eing more aggressive with respect to adding the dealer points.  \\n \\nAmit Syngle : \\nWhat we see is that today the opportunities obviously in terms of the dealer and retail points \\nis that we keep on looking at not only the smaller towns which are coming up, but we are also \\nlooking at a lot of suburbs of the bigger cities, which are expanding.  So, it's a combination of \\nlooking at retail points coming at both these points. What we also feel is that today , it's a \\njourney in terms of how the retailers start. They might do a certain amount of business in a \\nyear and they kind of keep on growing progress ively over the next 3 -5 years and therefore the \\ndrop  out of a dealer, from the point of view of year one  dealing with us to  kind of going to \\nyear three, year four is not very high because we look at putting  in a tinting  mechanism, which \\ngives them the flex ibility of earning more money given the fact that the retailer is able to cater \\nto a larger range of SKUs which he can offer to the customer.  \\n \\nIn our experience, what we feel is that this is a kind of journey which will continue given the \\nvastness of our c ountry and given the opportunities of now the larger road network , \\ngovernment infrastructure, the way it is developing . I think the opportunities are fairly huge. \\nFor example, if you look at the entire J&K portion today  and the opportunities  that have \\nopen ed are very big.  Similarly, look at North  East, given the connectivity of roads which is \\ncoming. So , I think these areas of expansion are going to continue and we feel that right from \\nyear one onwards, people get their ROI because at Asian Paints , we offer  them a very, very \\nhigh rotation of inventory and they keep on growing as the years go by. Some 5% of the retail \\nnetwork might drop out because of some liquidity crunch or some other personal problems \\nwhich might come in. But overall, I think the business model is pretty strong . \\n \\nSheela Rathi (Morgan Stanley) : \\nAnd we have not seen any change in terms of the pattern  it was say three years ago in terms \\nof, you know  the competitive intensity among the deal ers.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'ASIANPAINT_jul23.pdf', 'page': 27}, page_content=\"27 | P a g e  \\n Amit Syngle:  \\nNo, I don't think so, because the expansion really continues only because of the fact that, \\noverall connectivity, the whole economic activity is only increasing. I think the consumption is \\nalso going higher given housing, which is coming , and I think we wi ll not see any change in \\nthis for the next 5 -10 years.  \\n \\nRishi Mody  (Marcellus) : \\nMy first question is we  have seen the Kitchen and Bath business kind of struggl e to scale up \\nimmensely.  If you could take us through the journey, what have been the challenges ? What \\nare the bottlenecks today . How are we solving it and where are we in the journey before we \\ncan push the pedal on the gas to scale this up massively?  \\n \\nAmit Syngle:  \\nWhen you look at the last three years of journey, first year in Kitchen and Bath, we g rew almost \\nabout 35%.  Second year again, we would have grown at about 30-35%. Last year we grew \\nalmost about 10 -15%. So last year was a bit slow and this year in the first quarter, we are \\nseeing to some extent the business slowing down because of the large  base. \\n \\nSo, I would not say that the business has not grown. I think last three years , the combined \\nbusiness of the two entities is close to about Rs. 830 crores.  Therefore , this business has grown \\nfrom about  Rs. 500 crores to about Rs. 830 crore s, and I think that's a good increase, which \\nwe have seen in the last three years.  \\n \\nAs we go ahead, we should be able to add good overall growth . Kitchen also has a hardware \\nbusiness to it, which is called the components business, which also contributes to about 40 % \\nof the total Kitchen plus components business . This is the business that just kind of slowed \\ndown in the market because of certain price changes we implemented. And also , as I said, that \\nthese price changes were done in the last year, first quarter. So o verall, I think for both \\ncategories, we are still fairly buoyant in terms of what we see and more buoyant towards \\nKitchen because it is in sync with our strategy on Home Décor , when we look at our Beautiful \\nHome s stores . 44 stores today across the country,  and these stores are going to about 65 -70 \\nstores this year.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'ASIANPAINT_jul23.pdf', 'page': 28}, page_content=\"28 | P a g e  \\n And therefore, we feel that these stores will also give an impetus to both categories, along \\nwith the projects B2B business. Overall, we still see that these two businesses from a \\ntrajectory are going to be strong because the opportunity is huge.  \\n \\nRishi Mody (Marcellus):  \\nSo just wanted to get the clarification. You are happy with 30% growth rate for this Kitchen \\nand Bath business? You don't have  aspirations for doubling of business year on year. L ike, if \\nyou have those aspirations, what are the bottlenecks for doubling  or multi fold grow th in this \\ncategory?  \\n \\nAmit Syngle:  \\nHappiness is a relative state of mind . I might be happy with tripling business also going \\nforward, but you need to be practical in terms of the way you want to grow and not really \\nstrain the system. We have just put additional capacity for both the Kitchen and the Bath  \\nwhich has come up in Maharashtra so that we are able to really put a strong impetus . Going \\nforward , we are happy  if we are able to grow the business by about 25 -30% each year.  That's \\na fairly healthy rate in terms of growth . In terms of what we see . I think the idea here is that \\nyou look at strong consumer prop ositions and you look at possibly equipping your stores  in \\nterms of really carving a niche for yourself. So , I think we are taking really measured calls in \\nterms of the way we want to kind of go.  And as I said, I think we should be happy in terms of \\ngettin g about 25 -30% growth in this segment, which should be  a good indicator in terms of \\nour overall growth. We  have  always said that going forward, the whole Home Décor segment \\nshould be closer to about 7 -8% of our decorative sales  as we look at FY26. So , at the end of \\nFY26, that's the number we are gunning for. And I think that would be a strong number if we \\nare able to reach that.  \\n \\nRishi Mody (Marcellus):  \\nSecondly, there have  been a bit of a changes at the Board level. We have a new Chairman and \\nwe also have a new member joining the board.  So just wanted to get your understanding on \\nwhat are both of these guys bringing to the respective roles , that they've been assigned? How \\nare you viewing this appointment?\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'ASIANPAINT_jul23.pdf', 'page': 29}, page_content=\"29 | P a g e  \\n Amit Syngle:  \\nThis is in regular course. We have Mr. Deepak Satwalekar , who was the Chairman . His term  \\ncomes to an end in September  end and therefore we had to announce the new Chairman and \\nwe have Mr. R. Seshasayee  who takes  the Chair.  He comes with a ric h background in terms of \\nheading Ashok Leyland earlier and being at the helm of lot many other companies, including \\nInfosys. He comes with a very strong area of expertise and I think has been a strong directional \\nleader at Asian Paints in terms of his cont ribution to the Board.  So, I think that's the kind of \\ntransition in terms of what we are seeing, which is a natural transition and a strong one to o.  \\n \\nSecond is that we have one of our Directors who we had completed his term, Dr. S Sivaram, \\nand in place of  him, we are taking Mrs. Ireena  Vittal . She comes in again with strong \\nexperience. She has been with HDFC and other boards like Wipro. She brings in a strong area  \\nof capital to really energize us from the point of view of our thought with respect to newer \\nbusinesses , technologies and also with respect to the overall financial kind of management.  \\nSo, I think that's the thought in terms of looking at these two people . \\n \\nRishi Mody (Marcellus):  \\nAlright,  and finally, just a bookkeeping question. When we say NPD  contribution, is 11% of \\nsales, how do you define the NP D? Like , what period of launch were  these products launched \\nwithin?  \\n \\nAmit Syngle:  \\nSo normally it takes us a lmost about 1 -2 years to kind of launch the product and then sustain  \\nit.  So, we normally define it as NPD  over 3 years. So that's how a new  product  is defined.  \\n \\nAmit Rustagi  (UBS) : \\nI have a question relating to margins. If you look at the Q1 margins, they were pretty strong \\nvs. of a guided range of 18 -20%. So , what do you think is the best utilization of margin from \\nhere? Would it be more channel discounting or reinvestment? Or you t hink the price cuts ? So, \\nwhat do you think is  the status quo . What do you like to achieve from the excess margins you \\nhave?\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'ASIANPAINT_jul23.pdf', 'page': 30}, page_content=\"30 | P a g e  \\n Amit Syngle:  \\nWe don't really act on quarter to quarter in terms of the margins you get, because you have \\nseen the last two years, g iven the inflation, I think the margins had gone even lower than that \\nband. We take a considered view in terms of how the margins are emanating and whether \\nthey are stable from a point of view of overall business and environment. We would obviously \\nbe aggr essive with respect to  our ‘Above the line ’ and ‘Below the line ’ programs . In terms of \\nwhat we do in marketing and our share of voice in the market, our media spends and our \\nother marketing activities, including, various measures on really exciting the mar ket through \\nvarious schemes and discounting mechanisms.  I think that is first and foremost because we \\nare committing ourselves to growth and we will not let that growth go away. And we are pretty \\naggressive about that in terms of our thought .  \\n \\nOverall, as  we go ahead , depending on how the raw material  prices pan out, how the rupee \\ndollar parity pans out, we might look at even pricing corrections.  But I think we will really be \\nwatchful in terms of seeing what is there and just not react quarter to quarter. I think we take \\na considered call in terms of going forward. And that is something which possibly is the right \\nmechanism, as we see from the Asian Paints point of view.  \\n \\nAmit Rustagi (UBS):  \\nMy second question is , if we have to  resort to a price pass to the consumers, we have seen in \\nsome of the consumer companies , the channel inventories get impacted and the channel \\ninventory comes down impacting the prim ary sales . What do you think in our case , how the \\nprice cu ts will be imple mented and how would the channel react to  those price cu ts? \\n \\nAmit Syngle:  \\nSo as far as Asian Paints is  concerned, I think we don't depend on channel inventories a lot \\nbecause our channel inventories are to a minimum level because of the fact that  we are able \\nto service the retailer at least almost about two times in a day. And therefore, I think we don't \\nreally encourage too much loading the retailer in terms of inventories.  However, in some \\nmonths, if there are stocking months and if there is any price corrections, we are willing to \\ngive concession to the retailer in terms of a back linkage, which happens on certain stocks. I \\nthink it is something which goes in conjunction in terms of really seeing that both the\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'ASIANPAINT_jul23.pdf', 'page': 31}, page_content=\"31 | P a g e  \\n organization, the brand and the retailer , all benefit from what we are doing. So , I think the \\nconsidered call is very clearly that we take them alo ng with us so that even if they have stocked \\nfor some time, they should not be at a loss in terms of that stocking .  \\n \\nModerator:  \\nThank you so much for all your questions. Requesting Mr. Amit  Syngle  to please give his closing \\nremarks.  \\n \\nAmit Syngle:  \\nIt was good hearing questions  coming from your side. It's been a good quarter. I think we are \\nfairly satisfied with respect to the kind of overall numbers which have come in.  We are looking \\nforward to the long, festive season. And we feel that today the In dian story is still live in terms \\nof the overall demand conditions . Good monsoons coming is also a  positive indicator . The \\ncoming period should be a good one , as far as overall business goes. Thank you so much for \\ncoming and being with us today.  \\n \\n###\")]"

This has also  been a consistent \\npromise  and what we have  been pursuing for the last 12 quarters. We registered  double digit \\n10% volume growth . Over a four -year period , this was clearly a strong double -digit 17 .5% \\nCAGR . Even the value number was relatively strong at about 8%.  Please remember, that this \\nwas over a very  high base last year where we had grown by value of about 59%. It was also a \\nprice increase base and growing over a lower covid  base of previous year , 8% on t hat is a still \\na relatively healthy number delivered this quarter.  \\n \\nSimilarly, the volume base was strong at 37% over which 10% growth has come in.

The 4-year CAGR over the various quarters have been \\nin the band of about 15 -20%. This shows  our commitment to overall g rowth , and we have \\nbeen keeping pace with the same over previous  quarters .  \\n \\nGoing ahead , let’s take a  look at some of the parameters on how we would qualify the quarter . \\nFirst of all, I think the good part is that compared to Q3, Q4 of FY23, we saw rural growth \\ndefinitely improving and coming closer to the urban markets, which was a good sign.  \\n'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'ASIANPAINT_jul23.pdf', 'page': 5}, page_content='5 | P a g e  \\n We saw almost similar growth  between the two . Over a period of time , we are seeing that the \\n4-year CAGR across rural urban areas are kind of same.  The overall product mix was led by  the \\neconomy and premium range growing. The luxury range was  a bit down, but both economy \\nand premium range did well . \\n \\nIn terms of specifics , we saw Smart Care waterproofing, which has been on a strong growth \\npath over the previous qua rters continue to maintain growth.

Our Safe Painting Service  (SPS) , which comprises of the Trusted Contractor Service  \\n(TCS)  has done extremely well and now we are present in more than 650 to wns with  revenue \\nalmost doubling in Q1 . This signifi es that today  the trust levels of service are very high , and \\nwe speak of a fairly high NPS score. Overall , from the point of view of retail versus projects \\nbusiness, the projects /institutional business grew faster , and it was led by good construction \\nactivity which propelled the builder sector.  We saw good spending from government and also \\nfactories did quite well. This B2B part of the business has been spearheading growth in a very \\nstrong manne r for us . \\n \\nFrom a point of view of innovation , new products have been fairly consistent , and we have \\nbeen  speaking about the band of 11 -13% contribution to the overall revenues  This quarter , \\nalso we saw about an 11% contribution .

Thank you so much.  \\n \\nModerator:  \\nWe now begin the Q&A session .  \\n \\nAbneesh Roy  (Nuvama) : \\nMy first question is when I see your gross margin  that is at a 9-quarter  high and when  I see  \\nother FMC G categories like soaps and detergent, wherein also the gross margin expansion has \\nhappened, local and regional players have come back strongly in terms of either pricing or in \\nterms of local marketing.  So, could you take us t hrough what is happening in the 30% local \\nmarket share , which is there . Are you seeing players cutting prices, for example, and are they \\nalso starting more of  advertising  and what is your response to that? Because that's a large \\nmarket and you are equally aggressive in the lower end of the market.  \\n \\nAmit Syngle:  \\nFor us , the bottom of the pyramid is a very strong market , and we look at getting the \\nunorganized customer into the organized brand. Our work emanates in two manners. One is \\nin terms of expanding our  footprint so that we are able to reach out to smaller towns.  Second, \\nwe have a very strong program in terms of below the line marketing initiatives, in terms of \\nwhat we place in the market. So , whether it is work around influencers, whether it is the work  \\naround wooing the consumer, or it is  with respect to even the work in terms of looking at \\nbrand displays at the shops, I think we do a huge amount of work there too, so a large \\nexpenditure possibly goes.  Similarly, I think the differential schemes to woo the retailers to \\nstock the material and sell them at a strong incentive to the customers is what we do. So , our \\nconcentration has been led by below the line initiatives and topped with a focus on ‘Above \\nthe line ’ advertising.   \"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'ASIANPAINT_jul23.pdf', 'page': 22}, page_content='22 | P a g e  \\n  \\nGoing forward , we are lookin g at giving an impetus to our advertising and looking at these \\nbelow the line initiatives. What we see very clearly, is the strength of the brand w here we are \\nable to command a premium with respect to selling prices and despite the fact that we see \\nsome di scounting by local players and in some cases also advertising . Today our Q1results also \\nindicate in that segment we are able to really get good numbers and good response. So , I think \\nnet net our initiative of ‘Above the line ’ and ‘Below the line ’ will continue in a strong manner . \\nWe would  be strong with respect to our initiatives in terms of what we want to put to woo  the \\nconsumer  and we might even look in terms of saying that as we go forward, depending on \\nhow the raw material  prices fare out, we  will look if we need any price corrections.  \\n \\nShirish Pardes hi (Centrum) : \\nI do understand on a base of 37% volume growth, the volume is about 10% growth. But just \\nwanted to understand, because you made some remark, that the premium luxury segment is \\nnot to  the expectation in the middle and lower end is grown  faster.  Is this the industry trend \\nbecause the local competition has picked up very well and I think there is a pressure and \\nobviously the demand is high at the lower end. And in that context, I think I do understand \\nyou have prioritised  the gross margin and do you think in the medium term we have a pressure \\nto drop the prices?  \\n \\nAmit Syngle:  \\nThere is no middle and lower end premium and luxury . There are only three segments : \\neconomy segment, premium segme nt and luxury segment. What I said was that the economy \\nand the premium segments are doing well , and the luxury  is a little bit down. If you look at \\nthe market constraint,  the economy segment is the biggest segment which is there, followed \\nby premium and luxury.  And therefore , you will have to perform in the economy segment if \\nyou are looking at overall volume and value growth in terms of turn ing the tables. I think the \\npremium segment has also done fairly well , riding on wood finishes , riding  on adhesives  and \\nriding  on enamel s. \\n \\nOverall, we think the premium segment has been strong. I think the decision with respect to \\npricing is totally related to how the whole area of raw material prices pan out. We are now '),\n",

So, we are watching it carefully  \\nand if the trends are clear, we would look at price correction in that case . Having said that, we \\nare not  seeing local companies, at least in the paint industry, doing very well.  Possibly we \\nwould have gain ed from some of the local competition in terms of the overall economy \\nsegment.  \\n \\nShirish Pardeshi (Centrum) : \\nOn the non -decor  part, the Industrial business  and Home Improvement , The Industrial \\nbusiness has shown momentum .  So, in your sense, is it completely normalized because auto  \\nOEM  and auto refinish business has done exceedingly w ell, despite the high base. In that \\ncontext , is there further recovery expected or this is the normalized base and we can build on \\nthis. And second, on the Home Improvement, exactly what has gone wrong, because both  \\nSleek and Ess Ess have declined very sharply.  \\n \\nAmit Syngle:  \\nWhen we look at the Industrial business, I don't think  it has reached a place where it cannot \\ngrow and we did not have any price increase bas es there . I think they were normal bas es in \\nterms of what we saw last year. The General Industrial business comprising of Protective \\npaint s and Powder coating is something which is on the rise , and I think what we see is that \\nnot many industries are coming up. Players are expanding and we see a lot of opportunity in \\nthe government infrastructure business, which is also seeing a lot of money getting pumped \\nin. As far as auto is concerned, I think both  two-wheeler and  four-wheeler , we are seeing \\nstrong growth  with the additional lines, the whole area of EV coming up and so on and so \\nforth. Both businesses are promising that the uptick should continue in terms of the overall \\ndemand as we go ahead.  \\n \\nAs far as the overall Home Décor business is concerned, four categories have grown and two \\ncategories are down.  So, I don't think things are terri bly wrong there . In the two businesses, \\nwhich have degrown a little, we had very high bas es because of price increases and that could \\npossibly get corrected as we go ahead in Q2 and Q3.  \"),\n",

And even with respect to the Bath business, I think it will \\ndefinitely come up going  forward. So overall, I think net net , four categories have done well \\nvery c learly in terms of what is there and two categories have gone down.  Overall , Home \\nDécor, had a fairly good growth.  \\n \\nShirish Pardeshi (Centrum) : \\nSo, you think second half is going to be better as compared to the Q1 weakness ? \\n \\nAmit Syngle:  \\nWe think the business would definitely improve because the weakness was coming also \\nbecause of a little bit of a base which was very high.  So definitely there will be an \\nimprovement.  \\n \\nAvi Mehta  (Macquarie) : \\nI just wanted to build on the margin point a litt le. Basically, are there any one -offs in the other \\nexpenses that we saw this quarter?  And the second also related is because you are pointing \\ntowards resurgence of input costs, would you suggest that the current gross margin \\nperformance is something that c ould be at risk?  \\n \\nAmit Syngle:  \\nIf you take the t wo one -offs which were there, one is in terms of some dividend income which \\nwe got from our industrial JV  and the second has been a provision reversal with respect to \\nsick leave entitlement in terms  of the positive change for our employees going forward. I think \\nif you take out the one-offs, the margin position is still healthy . So, I don't think the one -offs \\nare really influencing the numbers in a strong manner. And secondly, the overall margin \\nnumbers are also closely governed by how raw material prices pan out in the market . You have \\nseen that during the whole period of inflation, when the inflation levels had gone to about 20 -\\n25-30% level s, despite taking price increases, the PBDIT  margins had gone almost to about 15 -\\n16% levels. Today the raw material  prices and  the environment makes a huge impact with \\nrespect to that.  We feel that for the year, our commitment to the overall band  of the PBDIT  \"),\n",

That is something which we are committing \\nfor the year , and which should remain.  \\n \\nAvi Mehta (Macquarie) : \\nI was just trying to push the bubble  by saying that given one does not have a material one \\ntime , what we saw almost about 2 3% margin, that logically one does not see any risk to that \\ncontinuing and hence there could be possibly an upside risk to your guidance ? \\n \\nAmit Syngle:  \\nYou are right as it depends also in terms of if we really look at some changes with respect to \\npricing i n other areas, then possibl y it woul d, come down and might not remain in this level.  \\nI mean if there is going forward in H2, we see a larger inflation kind of coming back. But I think \\nwe are in a good positive band in terms of what we are looking for  the y ear. \\n \\nAvi Mehta (Macquarie) : \\nJust a clarification. The festive demand strength should reflect in the next quarter because the \\nchannel gets filled . So, the longer festive period benefit should flow through in the second \\nquarter. Is that understanding correc t? \\n \\nAmit Syngle:  \\nWhat happens is that retail season is about at least about 45 days before the festival. So , if \\nDiwali is in the first week of November or in the first ten days of November, normally what \\nhappens is that the period from 15 September to Octo ber end would be a strong retail ing \\nseason.  We feel that the larger impact would come into Q3, but impact should come into Q2 \\nas well because there is a retailing period which gets impacted by the festive area. So , we \\nwould see that both quarters show an uptick with respect to the long festive season . \\n \\nSheel a Rathi  (Morgan Stanley) : \\nMy first question was with respect to the distribution, the dealer network, which we have \\nadded this quarter about 6 ,000 dealer  points and this year  we have guided to about 10 ,000 -\\n15,000  dealer points . Just wanted to understand we are looking to get more into smaller cities. \\nSo here what  I want ed to understand is do we have a number in mind in terms of how many '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'ASIANPAINT_jul23.pdf', 'page': 26}, page_content=\"26 | P a g e  \\n Asian Paints  dealers, a sma ll town could have? And  in general , how long does it take for the \\ndealer to generate the requisite ROI? And has there been any change in terms of the timing \\non generating the ROI; because, companies like yours and other competition  are also talking \\nabout b eing more aggressive with respect to adding the dealer points.  \\n \\nAmit Syngle : \\nWhat we see is that today the opportunities obviously in terms of the dealer and retail points \\nis that we keep on looking at not only the smaller towns which are coming up, but we are also \\nlooking at a lot of suburbs of the bigger cities, which are expanding.  So, it's a combination of \\nlooking at retail points coming at both these points. What we also feel is that today , it's a \\njourney in terms of how the retailers start. They might do a certain amount of business in a \\nyear and they kind of keep on growing progress ively over the next 3 -5 years and therefore the \\ndrop  out of a dealer, from the point of view of year one  dealing with us to  kind of going to \\nyear three, year four is not very high because we look at putting  in a tinting  mechanism, which \\ngives them the flex ibility of earning more money given the fact that the retailer is able to cater \\nto a larger range of SKUs which he can offer to the customer.  \\n \\nIn our experience, what we feel is that this is a kind of journey which will continue given the \\nvastness of our c ountry and given the opportunities of now the larger road network , \\ngovernment infrastructure, the way it is developing . I think the opportunities are fairly huge. \\nFor example, if you look at the entire J&K portion today  and the opportunities  that have \\nopen ed are very big.  Similarly, look at North  East, given the connectivity of roads which is \\ncoming. So , I think these areas of expansion are going to continue and we feel that right from \\nyear one onwards, people get their ROI because at Asian Paints , we offer  them a very, very \\nhigh rotation of inventory and they keep on growing as the years go by. Some 5% of the retail \\nnetwork might drop out because of some liquidity crunch or some other personal problems \\nwhich might come in. But overall, I think the business model is pretty strong . \\n \\nSheela Rathi (Morgan Stanley) : \\nAnd we have not seen any change in terms of the pattern  it was say three years ago in terms \\nof, you know  the competitive intensity among the deal ers. \\n \"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'ASIANPAINT_jul23.pdf', 'page': 27}, page_content=\"27 | P a g e  \\n Amit Syngle:  \\nNo, I don't think so, because the expansion really continues only because of the fact that, \\noverall connectivity, the whole economic activity is only increasing. I think the consumption is \\nalso going higher given housing, which is coming , and I think we wi ll not see any change in \\nthis for the next 5 -10 years.  \\n \\nRishi Mody  (Marcellus) : \\nMy first question is we  have seen the Kitchen and Bath business kind of struggl e to scale up \\nimmensely.  If you could take us through the journey, what have been the challenges ? What \\nare the bottlenecks today . How are we solving it and where are we in the journey before we \\ncan push the pedal on the gas to scale this up massively?  \\n \\nAmit Syngle:  \\nWhen you look at the last three years of journey, first year in Kitchen and Bath, we g rew almost \\nabout 35%.  Second year again, we would have grown at about 30-35%. Last year we grew \\nalmost about 10 -15%. So last year was a bit slow and this year in the first quarter, we are \\nseeing to some extent the business slowing down because of the large  base. \\n \\nSo, I would not say that the business has not grown. I think last three years , the combined \\nbusiness of the two entities is close to about Rs. 830 crores.  Therefore , this business has grown \\nfrom about  Rs. 500 crores to about Rs. 830 crore s, and I think that's a good increase, which \\nwe have seen in the last three years.  \\n \\nAs we go ahead, we should be able to add good overall growth . Kitchen also has a hardware \\nbusiness to it, which is called the components business, which also contributes to about 40 % \\nof the total Kitchen plus components business . This is the business that just kind of slowed \\ndown in the market because of certain price changes we implemented. And also , as I said, that \\nthese price changes were done in the last year, first quarter. So o verall, I think for both \\ncategories, we are still fairly buoyant in terms of what we see and more buoyant towards \\nKitchen because it is in sync with our strategy on Home Décor , when we look at our Beautiful \\nHome s stores . 44 stores today across the country,  and these stores are going to about 65 -70 \\nstores this year.  \"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'ASIANPAINT_jul23.pdf', 'page': 28}, page_content=\"28 | P a g e  \\n And therefore, we feel that these stores will also give an impetus to both categories, along \\nwith the projects B2B business. Overall, we still see that these two businesses from a \\ntrajectory are going to be strong because the opportunity is huge.  \\n \\nRishi Mody (Marcellus):  \\nSo just wanted to get the clarification. You are happy with 30% growth rate for this Kitchen \\nand Bath business? You don't have  aspirations for doubling of business year on year. L ike, if \\nyou have those aspirations, what are the bottlenecks for doubling  or multi fold grow th in this \\ncategory?  \\n \\nAmit Syngle:  \\nHappiness is a relative state of mind . I might be happy with tripling business also going \\nforward, but you need to be practical in terms of the way you want to grow and not really \\nstrain the system. We have just put additional capacity for both the Kitchen and the Bath  \\nwhich has come up in Maharashtra so that we are able to really put a strong impetus . Going \\nforward , we are happy  if we are able to grow the business by about 25 -30% each year.  That's \\na fairly healthy rate in terms of growth . In terms of what we see . I think the idea here is that \\nyou look at strong consumer prop ositions and you look at possibly equipping your stores  in \\nterms of really carving a niche for yourself. So , I think we are taking really measured calls in \\nterms of the way we want to kind of go.  And as I said, I think we should be happy in terms of \\ngettin g about 25 -30% growth in this segment, which should be  a good indicator in terms of \\nour overall growth. We  have  always said that going forward, the whole Home Décor segment \\nshould be closer to about 7 -8% of our decorative sales  as we look at FY26. So , at the end of \\nFY26, that's the number we are gunning for. And I think that would be a strong number if we \\nare able to reach that.  \\n \\nRishi Mody (Marcellus):  \\nSecondly, there have  been a bit of a changes at the Board level. We have a new Chairman and \\nwe also have a new member joining the board.  So just wanted to get your understanding on \\nwhat are both of these guys bringing to the respective roles , that they've been assigned? How \\nare you viewing this appointment?  \\n \"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'ASIANPAINT_jul23.pdf', 'page': 29}, page_content=\"29 | P a g e  \\n Amit Syngle:  \\nThis is in regular course. We have Mr. Deepak Satwalekar , who was the Chairman . His term  \\ncomes to an end in September  end and therefore we had to announce the new Chairman and \\nwe have Mr. R. Seshasayee  who takes  the Chair.  He comes with a ric h background in terms of \\nheading Ashok Leyland earlier and being at the helm of lot many other companies, including \\nInfosys. He comes with a very strong area of expertise and I think has been a strong directional \\nleader at Asian Paints in terms of his cont ribution to the Board.  So, I think that's the kind of \\ntransition in terms of what we are seeing, which is a natural transition and a strong one to o.  \\n \\nSecond is that we have one of our Directors who we had completed his term, Dr. S Sivaram, \\nand in place of  him, we are taking Mrs. Ireena  Vittal . She comes in again with strong \\nexperience. She has been with HDFC and other boards like Wipro. She brings in a strong area  \\nof capital to really energize us from the point of view of our thought with respect to newer \\nbusinesses , technologies and also with respect to the overall financial kind of management.  \\nSo, I think that's the thought in terms of looking at these two people . \\n \\nRishi Mody (Marcellus):  \\nAlright,  and finally, just a bookkeeping question. When we say NPD  contribution, is 11% of \\nsales, how do you define the NP D? Like , what period of launch were  these products launched \\nwithin?  \\n \\nAmit Syngle:  \\nSo normally it takes us a lmost about 1 -2 years to kind of launch the product and then sustain  \\nit.  So, we normally define it as NPD  over 3 years. So that's how a new  product  is defined.  \\n \\nAmit Rustagi  (UBS) : \\nI have a question relating to margins. If you look at the Q1 margins, they were pretty strong \\nvs. of a guided range of 18 -20%. So , what do you think is the best utilization of margin from \\nhere? Would it be more channel discounting or reinvestment? Or you t hink the price cuts ? So, \\nwhat do you think is  the status quo . What do you like to achieve from the excess margins you \\nhave?  \\n \"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'ASIANPAINT_jul23.pdf', 'page': 30}, page_content=\"30 | P a g e  \\n Amit Syngle:  \\nWe don't really act on quarter to quarter in terms of the margins you get, because you have \\nseen the last two years, g iven the inflation, I think the margins had gone even lower than that \\nband. We take a considered view in terms of how the margins are emanating and whether \\nthey are stable from a point of view of overall business and environment. We would obviously \\nbe aggr essive with respect to  our ‘Above the line ’ and ‘Below the line ’ programs . In terms of \\nwhat we do in marketing and our share of voice in the market, our media spends and our \\nother marketing activities, including, various measures on really exciting the mar ket through \\nvarious schemes and discounting mechanisms.  I think that is first and foremost because we \\nare committing ourselves to growth and we will not let that growth go away. And we are pretty \\naggressive about that in terms of our thought .  \\n \\nOverall, as  we go ahead , depending on how the raw material  prices pan out, how the rupee \\ndollar parity pans out, we might look at even pricing corrections.  But I think we will really be \\nwatchful in terms of seeing what is there and just not react quarter to quarter. I think we take \\na considered call in terms of going forward. And that is something which possibly is the right \\nmechanism, as we see from the Asian Paints point of view.  \\n \\nAmit Rustagi (UBS):  \\nMy second question is , if we have to  resort to a price pass to the consumers, we have seen in \\nsome of the consumer companies , the channel inventories get impacted and the channel \\ninventory comes down impacting the prim ary sales . What do you think in our case , how the \\nprice cu ts will be imple mented and how would the channel react to  those price cu ts? \\n \\nAmit Syngle:  \\nSo as far as Asian Paints is  concerned, I think we don't depend on channel inventories a lot \\nbecause our channel inventories are to a minimum level because of the fact that  we are able \\nto service the retailer at least almost about two times in a day. And therefore, I think we don't \\nreally encourage too much loading the retailer in terms of inventories.  However, in some \\nmonths, if there are stocking months and if there is any price corrections, we are willing to \\ngive concession to the retailer in terms of a back linkage, which happens on certain stocks. I \\nthink it is something which goes in conjunction in terms of really seeing that both the \"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'ASIANPAINT_jul23.pdf', 'page': 31}, page_content=\"31 | P a g e  \\n organization, the brand and the retailer , all benefit from what we are doing. So , I think the \\nconsidered call is very clearly that we take them alo ng with us so that even if they have stocked \\nfor some time, they should not be at a loss in terms of that stocking .  \\n \\nModerator:  \\nThank you so much for all your questions. Requesting Mr. Amit  Syngle  to please give his closing \\nremarks.  \\n \\nAmit Syngle:  \\nIt was good hearing questions  coming from your side. It's been a good quarter. I think we are \\nfairly satisfied with respect to the kind of overall numbers which have come in.  We are looking \\nforward to the long, festive season. And we feel that today the In dian story is still live in terms \\nof the overall demand conditions . Good monsoons coming is also a  positive indicator . The \\ncoming period should be a good one , as far as overall business goes. Thank you so much for \\ncoming and being with us today.  \\n \\n### \")]"
